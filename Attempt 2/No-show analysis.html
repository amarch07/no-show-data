Data Analyst Evaluation

1. I decided to analyze the No-Show Appointments Data. 

2. Questions pre-data analysis:
 
	1. What does this population of patients look like from a diagnosis (i.e. Diabetes, Alcoholism...)
	2. Overall, what was the percentage of patients who missed their visit?
	    2a. Did gender or age correlate with no-shows?
	3. Were their certain appointment days where the number of no-shows were greter than others?
	4. How did the time between when the patient scheduled their appointment and have their appointment
	   correlate with no-shows?

3.

4. I imported the csv excel file using two methods: unicodecsv and through pandas pd.read()


5. Summary and answering above posed questions:

	1. Patients with a defined diagnosis of Alcoholism, Diabetes, Handicap, and Hypertension were looked at. No-shows and 
	   those on scholarship (which I'm assuming is government assistance of some sort) were also evaluated. Hypertension had the 
	   greatest % of patients, but all of these categories fell under %20 of the total patient population.

	2. %20 of patients missed their appointment
	2a. The ratio of no-show/shows per age was explored. Those over age 50 appeared to make their appointments more 
	    than those younger than 50. After age 80, however, the ratio range was inconsistent. This may be to those over 
	    the age of 80 possibly relying on others for transportation to their appointments, poor memory, or illness that 
	    prevented them from leaving their home. Those under the age of legal driving age may have also been impacted by
	    being dependent on others to get them to their appointment.
	
	    65% of those who missed their appointment were females. However, there were several more females that had scheduled
	    appointments than males. When looking strictly at female total and female no-show numbers, 20% of females missed their
	    visits and 19% of males missed their appointments. It was important in this case to break down
	    women and men to truly see if this impacted chances they would no-show or if these numbers were due to females having
	    a higher total than males.

	3.  There was one week (last week of May) where the ratio between no-shows and visits made was higher. This could be due to several
	    factors. Weather or festivities taking place in the patient's community/neighborhoods could have caused this. It would be
	    interesting to see % of appointments made during the last week in May per neighborhood.

	4.  This was difficult for me to assess. I was able to group the necessary data together, but struggled with cleaning it up and comparing
	    these to reach a more definitive conclusion to this answer. I did find it easier when I converted the waitinDays from timedelta[ns] to days.
